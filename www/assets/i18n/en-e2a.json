Here’s how we define runout miles: the measurement (in miles) from when your tyres are mounted to when your tyres are taken out of service. Runout miles are necessary to help calculate your annual cost-per-mile.

    "weight_savings_explanation": "If MICHELIN X One tyres are selected in the first life configuration, you will be asked if you would like to calculate the potential weight savings.  We will ask you to provide a few more details about what you transport, so you can receive a customised view of the potential impacts of increased payload and increased revenue.  The weight savings tab is optional and does not have to be selected to complete the simulation.",
