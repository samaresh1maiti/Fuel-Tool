   "tire_runout_miles_explanation": "Please enter the tire runout miles in the respective fields below.  Here’s how we define runout miles: the measurement (in miles) from when your tires are mounted to when your tires are taken out of service. Runout miles are necessary to help calculate your annual cost-per-mile. And after we calculate your annual cost-per-mile, graphical summaries will be provided in the executive summary to help visualize the impact of runout miles and annual costs.",

   "blended_average_explanation": "Customize your results using the blended average tab. The blended average tab allows you to customize the simulation based on your mix of first life and second life simulations. After you have completed your first life and second life simulations, a mix of 50%/50% is the default, but it’s easy to modify those numbers to fit your operation.",
   "weight_savings_explanation": "If MICHELIN X One tires are selected in the first life configuration, you will be asked if you would like to calculate the potential weight savings.  We will ask you to provide a few more details about what you haul, so you can receive a customized view of the potential impacts of increased payload and increased revenue.  The weight savings tab is optional and does not have to be selected to complete the simulation.",
